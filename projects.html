      </div>
      <div class="project-description">
        <p>The topic of my bachelor thesis was "Symbol Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks for Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition". During this work I have done a lot of research on Convolutional Networks and applied techniques like semantic segmentation and object detection to the task of handwritten mathematical expression recognition.</p>
        
        <p>The work is based on newly (2012) released public dataset for online mathematical expressions as well as recent advancements in the CNNs for object detection. The results are compared to other systems and show promising performance on the symbol recognition task.</p>

        <p>Used technologies: CNNs, Caffe Deep Learning Framework, Python</p>

      </div>
      <div class="project-description">
        <p>During a practical coarse at university I have participated in the development of a reliable real-time health monitoring & communication system targeting to help workers in hazardous environments. Textile integrated sensors are used to gather precise health data which is sent in real-time over MQTT to the backend. The data is analyzed, stored and distributed to medical advisor and mission commander monitoring systems.</p>
        
        <p>Our team of 11 developers was split in 3 sub-teams. Being part of the Backend team I was involved in doing the high-level design, defining the API interfaces and MQTT Topic structure, development, code review and release management.</p>  

        <p>Used technologies: NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, MQTT, Docker</p>

      </div>
      <div class="project-description">
        <p>During my part-time job as working student I have performed an evaluation of the JavaScript frameworks for hybrid mobile application development. Consequently, I have been developing hybrid applications with the Sencha Touch and Ionic frameworks.</p>

        <p>The applications work on both Android &amp; iOS and utilize the PhoneGap/Cordova library to get access to the native APIs of the operating systems. This also allows for full offline support by persisting data on the phone's filesystem or in SQLite database.</p>

        <p>Used technologies: JavaScript, AngularJS, Ionic, Sencha Touch, PhoneGap/Cordova</p>

      </div>
      <div class="project-description">
        <p>During a practical coarse at university I have participated in the development of an iOS Application for home security system. The system uses a few types of sensors installed throughout the user's home and tries to detect unusual events. The user can be notified of such events via the application. The user can also check the status of the sensors (live and historic data) and interact with certain smart components in the house.
        </p>
        <p>The team consisted of 14 Students and 2 Project Leaders divided in Front- and Backend teams. Being part of the Frontend team I was involved in the Prototyping, Implemention &amp; Documentation of the iPhone application.</p>  

        <p>Used technologies: Swift, Xcode, Sketch</p>

      <div class="project-description">
        <p>Together with a fellow student, we submitted Othello/Reversi AI Player for a weekly competition that was part of the Functional Programming coarse at University. The solution implements Negamax with alpha-beta prunning coupled with a few heuristics. You can see the code on <a href="https://github.com/martomi/AI-Reversi" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

        <p>We ranked on 5th place out of 19 valid submissions and about 500 Students taking the course.</p>

      <div class="project-description">
        <p>Sometimes I like to spend weekends tinkering with new technologies and building smaller projects for fun. At those events I get the chance to work with hardware which I normally don't have access to as well as meet and work with people of different backgrounds and experience levels.</p>

        <p>I have attended many international hackathons in Germany, Switzerland and Canada. The projects I've worked on include websites, smartphone and smartwatch applications. Next on my list are VR / AR and hardware hacks.</p>
