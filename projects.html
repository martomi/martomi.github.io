          <h2>Home Security</h2>
          <p>System for burglary<br />preventation</p>

      </div>
      <div class="project-description">
        <p>During a practical coarse at university I have participated in the development of an iOS Application for home security system. The system uses a few types of sensors installed throughout the user's home and tries to detect unusual events. The user can be notified of such events via the application. The user can also check the status of the sensors (live and historic data) and interact with certain smart components in the house.
        </p>
        <p>The team consisted of 14 Students and 2 Project Leaders divided in Front- and Backend teams. Being part of the Frontend team I was involved in the Prototyping, Implemention &amp; Documentation of the iPhone application.</p>  

        <p>Used technologies: Swift, Xcode, Sketch</p>

      <div class="project-description">
        <p>During my part-time job as working student I have developed a hybrid mobile application for information management. The framework of choice was Sencha Touch as it provided better performance compared to many of the competing frameworks.</p>

        <p>The application works on Android &amp; iOS and utilizes the PhoneGap/Cordova library to get access to the native APIs of the operating systems.</p>

        <p>Used technologies: JavaScript, Sencha Touch, PhoneGap/Cordova</p>

      <div class="project-description">
        <p>Together with a fellow student, we submitted Othello/Reversi AI Player for a weekly competition that was part of the Functional Programming coarse at University. The solution implements Negamax with alpha-beta prunning coupled with a few heuristics. You can see the code on <a href="https://github.com/martomi/AI-Reversi" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

        <p>We ranked on 5th place out of 19 valid submissions and about 500 Students taking the course.</p>

        <p>One of my first websites. Initially released in 2009, later redesigned with Bootstrap. The website hosts among others a few beginner programming tutorials mainly for C++ as I have written them while learning the language at school.</p>

        <p>This website I have done in a short period of time for a project at school. Its idea was to host news, articles and discussions around the still at the time fairly new and not as popular smartphone industry.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately it doesnâ€™t exist anymore, but you can still take a look at some <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tfzy7kj7501qyyl/AADOJS0vZeBmI3Wu3eWF4PxJa?dl=0" target="_blank">screenshots</a> of the website.</p>
